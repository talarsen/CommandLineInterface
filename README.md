# CommandLineInterface

This is a reflection journal of how I learned the Command Line Interface. I am working/pair programming with another aspiring software engineer. Together we are using the Techtonica curriculum, Linux/Mac terminal video tutorials by Corey Shafer and CodeAcademy.

**Week 1: 12/29-1/3** We worked through the commands of cd, cp, mv, echo, grep, and echo. It has been time consuming to learn how navigate the file structure in the command line. I find it very rewarding to work in the command line and have realized how powerful it can be. The best two things that I learned this week was the the discovery of [The Art of the Command Line on gitHub.](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) and the curl cheat.sh/command which gives a brief "cheat sheet" with common examples of how to use a shell command.

**Week 2: 1/4-1/10**
